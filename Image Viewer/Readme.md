# Image Viewer Using Tkinter
------------------------


## About
This image viewer basically displays image on the screen and also adjust the image size according to the GUI size.

## Required Modules

 - **Tkinter** 
_tkinter is a most commonly used python framework for GUI Building, we are using tkinter for our project because it is built-in so we don’t need to install it and almost every python developer tried it once so you can easily understand what happening in our project code._

 - **PIL / Pillow :**
_python pillow is a image processing module and we are using it to resize our image size according to the GUI size.
Pillow is not a built-in module so we have to install it before importing using command._

    pip install Pillow

- **OS :**
_os stands for operating system, basically we are using this module to list all the image from a selected directory.
As like tkinter os is also a predefined module so you don’t need to install it using pip._
